<b>Overview:</b>
<br>
This network design mirrors the actual deployment in our Computer Science Department lab, It includes various configurations such as static and dynamic IP addressing, DHCP, IoT server, network controller, and wireless access points.
<br>

<b>Features:</b>
<br>
Static and Dynamic Addressing: Ensures reliable connectivity for critical devices and simplifies management for client devices.
<br>
<br>
Wireless Configuration: Provides comprehensive wireless coverage with WPA2 encryption.
<br>
DHCP Server: Automatically allocates IP addresses to client devices.
<br>
IoT Server: Centralized control and monitoring of IoT devices.
<br>
Network Controller: Manages and monitors network traffic for optimal performance and security.
<br>
<br>
Network Security: Implementation of basic security measures such as WPA2 encryption for wireless networks.
<br>

<b>Requirements:</b>
<br>
Cisco Packet Tracer: Version 8.0 or higher.
<br>
Git: For version control and collaboration.
<br>

<b>Usage:</b>
<br>
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
<br>
Switch to Physical Mode for better understandings.
<br>
<br>
To view the College Lab Network, Move to ISP Cluster -> College Cluster. 
<br>
Run simulations to test network functionality.
